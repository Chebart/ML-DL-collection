# ML & DL collection
In this repository you can find projects and scripts related to Machine and Deep Learning. I create them using Pytorch or OpenCV. I try to make the code as clear as possible, and the goal is to help people to figure out with different neural network architectures, ml-methods or find interesting and useful projects.:blush: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
